## **Controlled Redundancy & Denormalization**
Normalization ensures **data integrity**, but it may slow down performance. **Denormalization** **(controlled redundancy)** is sometimes used to speed up queries by storing **precomputed** or **duplicated** data. Denormalization introduces redundancy in a controlled by relaxing the normalization rules. As a rule of thumb, if performance is unsatisfactory,and a table has a low update rate and a very high query rate, denormalization may be an viable option.

**Example: Adding `total_sales` in `Customers` to avoid recalculating it from `Orders` every time.**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Customers ADD COLUMN total_sales DECIMAL(10,2);
```
ðŸ“Œ **Denormalization improves reads but makes updates more complex.**

**Example: Storing Aggregated Values (Precomputed Totals)**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Customers ADD COLUMN total_sales DECIMAL(10,2);
```
ðŸ“Œ **Denormalization improves reads but makes updates more complex.**

# **Monitoring & Tuning**
## **ðŸ”¹ Monitoring MySQL Performance**
1. **Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze query execution:**
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Players WHERE username = 'Player123';
   ```
2. **Monitor slow queries (`slow_query_log` in MySQL).**
3. **Use MySQL Workbench performance dashboards.**
